    "### About Limiting the visible part of the trajectory\n",
    "Problem:\n",
    "PyGame gives us a function, draw.aalines, for drawing a trajectory with a list of points. \n",
    "We have a list of points forming the target trajectory (in an arbitrary resolution, currently 768x1024). \n",
    "At each iteration of the game, we want to:\n",
    "    1- Select a subset of the points,\n",
    "    2- Draw them on the screen properly in another scale. This requires applying \n",
    "    a 1-1 mapping to the points.    \n",
    "        This includes rotating the trajectory the same way as in car racing games.\n",
    "    3- Calulate the performance. If we later want to have a good representation (e.g. plot) of the cursor trajectory, applying the reverse of the original mapping might be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The mapping\n",
    "- Calculate the mean of the points. Align that with the middle of the screen.\n",
    "- Scale the points related to the axis by a fixed factor, e.g. 3 or 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue with the above approach is that taking the cursor trajectory back to the original coordinates will be hard/problematic. The same problem may also happen for the other kinds of processing that we do in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "A whole different approach would be not doing any of these. Instead just block the other areas of the trajectory. In this case, in order to avoid giving cues to the user,\n",
    "the size of the whole trajectory should be relatively small compared to the size of the screen.\n"
